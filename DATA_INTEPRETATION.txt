The data are the result of each subject performing the following TASKS in a laboratory:
1) Password Entry ? 3 different passwords, each typed 20 times
2 ) Free Text
10 questions (8 Survey style, 2 Scene Description)
500 characters typed for each question
3) Transcription ? Steve Job?s Commencement Speech

There is one folder for each subject, named by subject id. 

Under each folder, there are two files, one for each session where the subject was invited into the lab to contribute some typing. For example, under folder 1227981,
you will find two files 1227981_V1.txt (session 1) and 1227981_V2.txt (session 2) for subject 1227981.
Note that there are three or four subjects who have data only for one session.

Within each file, there are multiple lines, each corresponding to one typing activity the subject did in the lab session.
The format of each line is explained as follows, using the first line that I took from 1227981_V1.txt as example:

Each line is separated into four fields by tab.

a: 0 key pressed; 1 key released
b: key code
c: time stamp in millisecond
d: time lapse since last keystroke, which is redundant information. e.g. 62 = 1312903092295 -1312903092233
